# Business-Insights_360

## Project Overview

AtliQ Hardware has experienced significant growth in recent years and has decided to leverage data analytics through Power BI to stay ahead of its competitors. This project marks their first foray into data-driven decision-making, aiming to address stakeholders' questions across key domains such as finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain management.

I developed this project by following the Codebasics Power BI Course. You can find the course [here](https://codebasics.io/bootcamps/data-analytics-bootcamp-with-practical-job-assistance).

## Company's Background

AltiQ Hardware is a rapidly expanding company with a global presence, specializing in the sale of computers and computer accessories through three main channels:

Retailers
Direct Sales
Distributors

Recently, the company faced unexpected losses from opening a store in America, despite relying on surveys, intuition, and Excel analysis. Additionally, competitors have established analytics teams to drive data-informed decisions. To stay competitive, AltiQ Hardware needs to build its own analytics team to gain valuable insights and make data-driven decisions.

Project Kickoff

Before starting the project, itâ€™s crucial to clarify the purpose and scope. Here are some key questions to address:

1. What is the primary objective of building this Power BI dashboard?
2. How will the success of this project be measured?
3. What is the project deadline?
4. Do stakeholders expect a preview before the final release?
5. What are the stakeholdersâ€™ expectations from this project?
6. What concerns or fears do stakeholders have regarding the dashboard?
7. Who will be using this dashboard and for what purposes?
8. What are the stakeholders' expectations upon project completion?
9. What potential issues could arise during the project?
10. What resources or data are needed to build this dashboard?
11. Are there any stakeholder inputs on the design and layout of the dashboard?

Following the project kickoff meeting, the data engineering team will provide the requested data to the analytics team. 
Letâ€™s explore the data and begin the analysis.

## Dataset Understanding

Gaining a thorough understanding of the available data is crucial for effective analysis. Before diving into the analysis, take time to familiarize yourself with the data at hand. This includes:

- Identifying the Data Sources: Determine where the data is coming from and its relevance to the project.
- Understanding Data Structure: Review the data format, organization, and relationships between datasets.
- Assessing Data Quality: Check for completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data.
- Recognizing Data Types: Identify the different types of data (e.g., numerical, categorical) and their implications for analysis.
- Exploring Data Variables: Understand what each variable represents and how it contributes to the analysis.

A clear grasp of these aspects will provide a solid foundation for performing meaningful and accurate analysis.
