# Business-Insights_360

## Project Overview

AtliQ Hardware has experienced significant growth in recent years and has decided to leverage data analytics through Power BI to stay ahead of its competitors. This project marks their first foray into data-driven decision-making, aiming to address stakeholders' questions across key domains such as finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain management.

I developed this project by following the Codebasics Power BI Course. You can find the course [here](https://codebasics.io/bootcamps/data-analytics-bootcamp-with-practical-job-assistance).
